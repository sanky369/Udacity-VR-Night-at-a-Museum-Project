# Udacity-VR-Night-at-a-Museum-Project
This is my fifth project (Night at a Museum) in the Udacity VR Nanodegree program.  
Details: 
Project Overview: You will be doing research on a VR company/technology, or an industry that could be impacted by VR. After conducting your research, you will be creating a mobile virtual reality experience with 'information booths' which include both visual and audio feedback for users. These booths should showcase your findings - the goal here is to inform other people about the topic at hand in a fun and creative way through a series of (at least five) display points. Users should be able to travel back and forth between display areas inside the space. This is not a VR slideshow, it is a VR space which contains the information about your research. Some potential outputs of this project are creating a scene in a museum, science fair, or gallery-like space which showcases your findings.

Why this project? - You learned a lot about VR platforms and technology, and we'd like you to take a step further an investigate a VR company or technology, or an industry that could be impacted by VR and how. VR is in the early stages, and new developments are happening every day. Learning how to stay abreast of developments, and keep your eyes on the horizon of the future for VR will be critical for your career as a VR content creator.

My Work: I have created a VR experience showing a city exhibition. The user is in the center of a display area where there are 5 displays. He/She can navigate to all the displays and watch how VR is impacting education. He/She will also see how it will be to learn in VR in the future. I have used AVPro free Unity plugin to display the videos. The user can navigate to the display by clicking the visit button above the display. For displaying the city, a cubemap skybox is used.
