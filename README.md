# Udacity-VR-Night-at-a-Museum-Project
This is my fifth project (Night at a Museum) in the Udacity VR Nanodegree program.  Details: Project Overview: You will be doing research on a VR company/technology, or an industry that could be impacted by VR. After conducting your research, you will be creating a mobile virtual reality experience with 'information booths' which include both visual and audio feedback for users. These booths should showcase your findings - the goal here is to inform other people about the topic at hand in a fun and creative way through a series of (at least five) display points. Users should be able to travel back and forth between display areas inside the space. This is not a VR slideshow, it is a VR space which contains the information about your research. Some potential outputs of this project are creating a scene in a museum, science fair, or gallery-like space which showcases your findings.
